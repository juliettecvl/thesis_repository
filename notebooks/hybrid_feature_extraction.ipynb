X_p300 is filtered to have only valid entries. Then, it finds the minimum amount of trials in all three variables, for X_alpha and X_p300 this is the same, as they both have 80 trials. Because X_p300 exceeds this, it only selects the first 80 trials (which should correspond to only the trials, and ignore the epochs).\n",

The second approach loads the data, and then takes the average of the data across all epochs for each trial, so that each trial will only have one value per channel instead of multiple values per epoch. The shape changes from (n_trials, n_epochs, n_channels, n_features) to (n_trials, n_channels, n_features). In the next step, the data is flattened to (n_trials, n_channels * n_features). In the cross-validation, the NaN values are set to 0 to ensure valid processing (instead of calling the filter_valid_epochs function).\n",

Each trial now has a single value per channel for the features, rather than one value per epoch. Then, it calculates the average across all channels for each trial. The shape becomes (n_trials, n_features). Each trial now has one single feature vector, where the values for each feature are the average of all the channels\n",

On the other hand, y_p300 can also be used, but then more preprocessing steps have to be done because of the differences in dimensionality. Therefore, a more simpler approach such as using y_cvep is chosen."
